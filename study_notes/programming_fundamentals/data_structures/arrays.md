# Big O of Arrays

Push and pop are O(1) operations, because there is no reindexing

Shift Unshift are O(n) where in is the number of items in the array because of reindexing

Search by value O(n) search by index O(1)

Array is great if you need to access things by index

Not great if you want to add and remove a lot of items at the beginning
