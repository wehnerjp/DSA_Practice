# Graphs

* Similar to a linked list in that you have nodes linked to other nodes
* In this case the pointers are called edges and edges can have numbers assigned to them ie the length between new york and LA
* Social Media relationships are represented in graphs

    Directed: A -> B; One way relationship
    Indirected:
